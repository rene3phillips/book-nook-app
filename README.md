# BookNook

BookNook is an interactive web app that allows users to manage and track their book collections. It provides personalized views for managing books, such as a 'Library,' 'Wishlist,' and 'Read List.' Users can also search for books using the Google Books API and store their data in real-time with Firestore. The app includes features like user authentication and persistent data storage.

### Inspiration
The inspiration for BookNook comes from my daughter and her love for reading. She wanted a way to track all the books she has read, and this app gives her a personalized space to store her books, whether they are on her 'Library,' 'Wishlist,' or 'Read List.' It's a way to help her keep track of her literary journey and share it with others.
